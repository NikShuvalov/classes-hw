//        Main class requirements
//
//Create your main() method here - this is where you create and manipulate instances of the other classes; do the following steps inside main()
//        Create a new instance of User
//        Create at least 5 new instances of Song and assign each to a variable (You can come up with creative values or just use "song1", "artist1", etc.)
//        Create at least 2 instances of Playlist, add multiple Song objects to each, then add those Playlist objects to your User object
//        Use the methods you defined and print out the names of your user's playlists, then "play" each song in each playlist so the songs print out as well
//        Bonus:
//
//        Add methods to each class which can be used to edit the values of the member variables
//        Add a method to User to remove a Playlist by name
//        Call your bonus methods from main() to make sure they work properly (hint: if you change a playlist's name, you'll need to first remove it from User by specifying the old name as a key, then re-add it using the new name as the new key)
